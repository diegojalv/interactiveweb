    <h1>Moving to the US</h1>
    <p>At the age of 15, I took a courageous step and moved to the United States with a dream for a better life and the pursuit of education. This journey was not an easy one, but it shaped who I am today.</p>
    <p>Leaving my parents behind, I arrived in a new country with determination and hope.
    <p>During my sophomore year in college, life presented me with another unexpected but joyous challenge. I became a father to a wonderful daughter. Balancing academics, soccer, and fatherhood was tough, but it fueled my motivation to overcome every adversity.</p>
